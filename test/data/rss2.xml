				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_50" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://daurmith.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/cafe_bombon2.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-50" title="Cafe_bombon2" src="https://daurmith.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/cafe_bombon2.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="Café bombón" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is a bombón. Now you know.</p></div>
<p>&#8230; Pay attention. This isn&#8217;t as easy as it may seem.</p>
<p>First of all, don&#8217;t go to a Starbucks. You&#8217;re in Spain, so suck it up and go to a cafetería. Try for one called Bar Paco, or Cafetería La Estrella, or some improbable combination created mixing together syllables of the owner&#8217;s offspring&#8217;s names, like MayMoBor (which I just made up but may very well exist.)</p>
<p>Already there? Good. Sit at the bar. Depending on the authenticity of the place you chose, you&#8217;re risking getting stuck to it forever, but that&#8217;s part of the charm. Now comes the good part: be very, very aware of where in Spain you are, because your coffee enjoyment depends on this.</p>
<p>If you ask for a &#8220;café&#8221; and you&#8217;re in Madrid, they will give you a shot of espresso in a medium glass, topped with milk. Anywhere else, that&#8217;s a <em>café con leche</em>, except it&#8217;s usually served in a cup. Except in Sevilla, where it&#8217;s served in a glass but it&#8217;s called a &#8220;cortado&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, a &#8220;cortado&#8221; in Valencia is a shot of espresso with a bit of milk (please specify if you want hot or cold milk), served in a small glass. If you don&#8217;t like espresso, you can order an &#8220;americano&#8221;, but careful: that&#8217;s just an espresso with added water. In some places the cortado is served in a cup, but don&#8217;t count on it.</p>
<p>If you want more milk, then it&#8217;s a &#8220;café con leche&#8221;, except in Madrid, where that is called a &#8220;cortado&#8221;.</p>
<p>Confused yet? Don&#8217;t be! If in Valencia, try a &#8220;bombón&#8221;, a shot of espresso (picking a pattern here) with condensed milk. Don&#8217;t try this in Madrid, they don&#8217;t know anything about bombones. Yes, I&#8217;m from Valencia, why do you ask?</p>
<p>Now for the difficult stuff: in Canarias, you can order a bombón, but also a <em>leche y leche</em>, which is a bombón with milk. Yes, it&#8217;s coffee with condensed milk <em>and</em> milk. Add rum and you have a <em>barraquito</em>. Don&#8217;t drive if you try this.</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re skirting the dangerous shores of alcoholic beverages, a <em>carajillo</em> is an espresso with some liquor: cognac, brandy, rum, anisette. You can also add alcohol to any café, in that case the coffee is called &#8220;café tocado&#8221;.</p>
<p>But wait! We&#8217;re not done! Spain is a warm country. &#8220;Warm&#8221; as in &#8220;welcoming&#8221;, but also &#8220;warm&#8221; as in &#8220;hot like Hell sometimes&#8221;, so you may want a cold coffee drink. Nothing easier! In Madrid, this is called a &#8220;café con hielo&#8221;, coffee with ice. Logical! Easy! &#8230; And incredibly useless if you go to Valencia, where you must ask for a &#8220;café del tiempo&#8221;. This will get you a glass with a couple of ice cubes and a slice of lemon inside, and a cup of espresso served separately. Just stir the sugar in, pour into the ice-and-lemon-glass, and enjoy! Of course, some wicked pharisées will get rid of the lemon. Their loss. Oh, and asking for a &#8220;nube&#8221; in Málaga and whereabouts will get you a long glass of coffee with milk and ice that&#8217;s actually very good.</p>
<p>Still with me? I commend you. And if you&#8217;re thinking of asking for help, you&#8217;re not the only one, because I don&#8217;t know the peculiarities of the rest of Spain, and probably someone will correct me angrily about some of what I&#8217;ve written here. But take it as a first effort, and a useful tip if you really want to cause a good impression when ordering coffee. We&#8217;ll be, I can assure you, <em>impressed.</em></p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/daurmith.wordpress.com/45/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/daurmith.wordpress.com/45/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=daurmith.wordpress.com&#038;blog=9113735&#038;post=45&#038;subd=daurmith&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_35" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://daurmith.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_0031.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-35" title="Orgaz" src="https://daurmith.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/img_0031.jpg?w=300&#038;h=300" alt="Castillo del Conde de Orgaz" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;I&#039;m telling you, I heard something, Your Excellency...&quot;</p></div>
<p>Right. Picture yourself in Spain, around the XVI century. You are in a thriving  town called <a title="This is Segorbe. Come visit!" href="http://www.geolocation.ws/v/P/38198001/catedral-segorbe-castelln/en" target="_blank">Segorbe</a>, which by a quirky mixture of politics, religion, war and intrigue has become quite an important place at this time. So much so that it has its own Cathedral.</p>
<p>Now, when I say <em>Cathedral</em>, I imagine you see Notre Dame, or something like that. This is nothing of the sort. It&#8217;s far, far smaller. Smaller than many churches and abbeys that still grace Europe. And, yes, it&#8217;s gothic, but not the airy, tinted-glass-invaded gothic of the <a title="Sainte-Chapelle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Chapelle" target="_blank">Sainte-Chapelle</a>. This is Mediterranean gothic: solid yet graceful stone halls with smaller windows that nevertheless let in the powerful Mediterranean sunlight like so much good golden wine.</p>
<p>Moreover, a Cathedral was something different back then; not so much a building as a conglomerate: a church, a palace, and part of the powerful walls surrounding the city. And the crypts, and the belltower, and some other assorted buildings. Even now, when you go to Segorbe, you&#8217;ll be seeing the Cathedral church to your right, and a sign that will tell you the Cathedral entrance is in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>This Cathedral has a small cloister, where poor people were buried. Rich people went to the crypt, a nicely-organized handful of chambers with neat niches where the powerful could rest in peace, unperturbed by the populace. By way of coincidence &#8212; and because the building plans of the time were a bit erratic &#8212; the crypt was flush with the city walls, and <em>just</em> underneath the cathedral&#8217;s chapterhouse. You can see where this is going.</p>
<p>Segorbe&#8217;s chapterhouse is small, and not very imposing. Maybe an architect would drool a bit over the ingenious way the quadrangular room turns octagonal in its upper third. Historias drool for real &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen it &#8212; when they point out this was probably the first chamber of its kind in Spain, ever. But to the untrained eye, it&#8217;s just a nice room, with a large window, an impressive Renaissance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reredos" target="_blank">reredos</a>, and a collection of sinister portraits of church VIPs of the past.</p>
<p>When said VIPs were alive, they used to mingle, argue, conspire, negotiate, or a bit of everything, in the chapterhouse. And one can easily imagine the silence that fell when they started hearing noises. From underneath.<span id="more-27"></span></p>
<p>The 16th century in Spain is a time when people are totally, absolutely convinced of the resurrection of the bodies and all that stuff. And these bishops and cardinals and priests are not only convinced; they are <em>professionals</em>. They preach about this stuff all the time. The nearby Cathedral is filled with depictions of Purgatory, of the dead rising from their tombs, of the torments of Hell. They know all the signs. And it looks like the Apocalypse has started early this season.</p>
<p>The dead are clearly restless; this is no vague muttering, no eerie sigh they hear from underneath. These are angry corpses, violent dead, maybe feeling the heat of the flames already. Their bumps and knocks reverberate in the chapterhouse. One pictures them running around in circles in their rage and horror, hitting only solid stone, their recently-vacated graves, each other. One imagines them searching for a way out.</p>
<p>The theological discussion must have gotten a bit heated at this point, methinks.</p>
<p>History doesn&#8217;t give us the name of the man who kept his cool long enough to ask for a mason to come and lift the floor slabs. It&#8217;s a pity; that man would have made a good teacher. In any case, the mason came, and lifted away, until the darkness of the crypt was looking at the gathered clergy.</p>
<p>Allow me a small disgression at this point.</p>
<p>One bit of trivia about the walls that surround the city: they are <em>thick</em>. They were able to protect the city against all kinds of enemies &#8212; and sometimes against allies turned enemies; those were strange times. But there&#8217;s peace now, and the walls are simply an obstacle in the way if you want to take the sheep out. Or, if you look at it from a different, more practical perspective, a ready-made wall for your brand new house.</p>
<p>This was commonplace in those times: when the wall outlived its purely defensive purpose, it became a sort of convenient pre-arranged wall for you to build your house against. A few holes to hold some wooden beams, and <em>voilá</em>! Instant <em>bourg</em>. Segorbe was no exception, and already large sections of wall had been swallowed by the urban expansion.</p>
<p>So had been the part of the wall behind which the crypt was. An enterprising family had been working with the pickaxe, and when they found empty space instead of more stone, they went &#8220;um&#8221; and kept working. And found themselves an extra room, which was nice, what with Grandpa getting older, and who cared if the place was full of sarcophagi, which of course they called something else. The dead are good neighbours and we can use the space.</p>
<p>So they there were, living happily ever after along with the ones who didn&#8217;t, when there was a commotion over their heads, a hole appeared in their ceiling, and an assembly of clergy poked their heads in and asked, none too kindly, what the [CENSORED] they &#8212; the family &#8212; thought they were doing in their &#8212; the clergy &#8212; crypt.</p>
<p>And thus ends the story of the ghosts of the Segorbe Cathedral. Which was told by a historian, in the very same crypt the family was living in, to the enjoyment of his audience, among which I was.</p>
<p>And since I&#8217;m telling you, now you know it too. Pass it on! Amaze your friends! Delight a historian! Annoy strangers in the bus!</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/daurmith.wordpress.com/27/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/daurmith.wordpress.com/27/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=daurmith.wordpress.com&#038;blog=9113735&#038;post=27&#038;subd=daurmith&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.tamlondon.org/" target="_blank">TAM</a>&#8216;s over. It was my first TAM, and my biggest skeptic convention ever, since skepticism in Spain is a bit noisy but mostly disperse, centered about protesting woo in Universities, which is a good and necessary thing, but it&#8217;s far from having an impact in Spanish society, who happily buys into homeopathy, astrology, acupuncture, and such other assorted woo.</p>
<p>I gave myself this TAM as a gift (this last year has been quite grueling but it ended well and I thought I deserved a prize), and oh boy. What a gift it&#8217;s been. </p>
<p>Where to start?</p>
<p>The speakers were excellent, funny, interesting and moving. A couple of them seemed a bit of an odd choice (Alan Moore in a skeptic&#8217;s conference?)  but turned out to be great. Rchard Wiseman was an excellent host, the organization was very good, and the company absolutely charming. There was a very nice atmosphere the whole weekend, everybody was enjoying themselves and letting it known. I was sad when it ended, and also felt very glad to have been there. </p>
<p>So that&#8217;s the summary. Later on, details.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh yeah. And here I thought the US had a monopoly on weird.</p>
<p>Well, no: in the UK, <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/122580/Last-orders-for-the-traditional-pint-beer-glass" target="_blank">they want to reduce the number of &#8216;glassing&#8217; injuries by making safer beer glasses</a>. I kid you not. Apparently, <em>glassing</em> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassing" target="_blank">a physical attack using a glass as a weapon</a> (the things you learn on teh interwebs), and lots of people are hurt in glassing incidents in the UK. So they decided the solution was to make safer glasses. Because when the violent drunk who wants to gut you cannot find a nice glass to use as weapon, violence will stop! See? The logic is irrefutable!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the cunning plan to make safer chairs (foam?), safer ashtrays (hey, who smokes nowadays, right? Let&#8217;s get rid of them all!), safer tables (er, sorry, I got nothing), and probably safer bricks. Because, safer people? Not in the plans, dear.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/daurmith.wordpress.com/22/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/daurmith.wordpress.com/22/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=daurmith.wordpress.com&#038;blog=9113735&#038;post=22&#038;subd=daurmith&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why do I keep reading <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula" target="_blank">Pharyngula</a> daily? Well, because of all the cool science stuff. And the window into the -sort of- minds of all kinds of kooks. And PZ&#8217;s inspired rants. And the polls. <em>And</em> the squids, of course. But today I got depressed while reading <a title="Evil people" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/08/witch_hunt_in_illinois.php" target="_blank">this entry</a>. I know people like that exist, of course. They exist because then live in an environment that gives them lots of positive feedback (tacit or otherwise) when they write that sort of crap.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see anything at all wrong about <a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/" target="_blank">Hermant Metha</a> or his blog. He&#8217;s funny, articulate, often brilliant, and a good teacher. He happens to write about some ideas that come as a shock to many in the US. But are those ideas really that terrible? I see them more as shocking, in the sense that people are not really used to the novel concept that <em>religion</em>, as a concept, can be criticized, just like any other concept.</p>
<p>We (Western <em>we</em>, I mean) are immersed in a culture that carries roughly 2000 years of religion around. For much of that time, religion (Christian religion, mainly) has been given a special status, with lots of cultural taboos associated to it. It&#8217;s <em>bad form</em> to criticize the Church (any church), to mock weird religious ideas (lest they mock <em>your</em> weird religious ideas, shock horror), to be anything less than respectful and silent when The Church speaks. No other type of social glue (sports, politics, entertainment) enjoys this kind of privilege, and some of them have been around longer than the guys in robes.</p>
<p>We are so used to this that we hardly even question it. It&#8217;s just the way things are. You may secretly think that the particular branch of religion into which you were born is a load of nonsense, but you&#8217;d probably find it difficult to say so. You&#8217;d probably even think that you&#8217;re a bad person just for thinking it, much less saying it. Would you be so shy to announce that football bores you? Or that you&#8217;re not a socialist? I thought not.</p>
<p>Familiarity breeds out critical thinking. Things are the way they are because they&#8217;ve always been that way, and if they&#8217;ve been like this so long, why change? That&#8217;s why the woman who wants Mr. Metha to stop teaching can write that astonishingly wicked letter and not raise public outrage save from a few atheists, free-thinkers and such.</p>
<p>Now, this is a very American, or maybe anglo-saxon, phenomenon. For all the influence the Catholic Church still has here in Spain (and that&#8217;s a lot), I cannot conceive of any person writing such a letter here. I&#8217;m an atheist and I have absolutely no need to hide it. Nor to proclaim it, either. It&#8217;s my choice and no-one bothers me about it, nor questions my ability to perform well in my professional life because of it. If someone asks me about my religion, I answer I have none, and nothing happens.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I get depressed reading stuff like the Pharyngula story. I lived in the US for five years and I loved it to bits. Such a beautiful country with such charming, generous, kind people. It&#8217;s a pity some of them still have to deal with this kind of stupidity.</p>
<p>On the bright side, you have PZ Myers. Lucky b*st*rds.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/daurmith.wordpress.com/11/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/daurmith.wordpress.com/11/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=daurmith.wordpress.com&#038;blog=9113735&#038;post=11&#038;subd=daurmith&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Not that I expect to take the world by storm or anything. But a few years back I wrote about being a Spaniard in the US of A. So, maybe I can write about being a Spaniard in Spain, which is weird enough, and also maybe I can use this to rant about the things that interest me (but not most of Spain), i.e. science, critical thinking, and taking pleasure in learning new things.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/daurmith.wordpress.com/1/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/daurmith.wordpress.com/1/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=daurmith.wordpress.com&#038;blog=9113735&#038;post=1&#038;subd=daurmith&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

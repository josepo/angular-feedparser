		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2015/09/29/respect/"><![CDATA[<p>The sign said &#8220;hot coffee,&#8221; the door was open, and the music was loud. </p>
<p>I heard a young woman belting out the final few words of a classic  folk song and I stopped in my tracks. I peeked through the doorway and saw a performance in progress. Open mic night, it appeared. </p>
<p>I had the whole evening open and not much to do, so I slipped inside and ordered a drink. The young woman finished her number and made her way offstage. The proprietor announced the next performer.</p>
<p>She seemed to be completely tone-deaf and made frequent mistakes, awkwardly stopping and then re-starting various songs on her guitar. She had no charming banter in between songs. No stories. No charisma. The whole situation felt like such a bummer, especially compared with the last performer, who was so soulful and mesmerizing. The last one had been so good. This was so&#8230; not.</p>
<p>I felt myself cringing in my chair, feeling worried and embarrassed for the current performer. I glanced around the room, eyeing other people, expecting to see smirking, laughter, or people quietly mocking her. </p>
<p>To the contrary, everyone listened politely, applauding often, nodding, smiling, sipping their beverages and just giving this woman the time and space to do her thing. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m being a bully. </em></p>
<p>I might not be doing it out loud, in words, or in actions, but secretly, privately, inside my own mind, I am cruelly bullying this performer. Thinking all kinds of mean things about her. Mocking her. Pitying her. And why?</p>
<p>She is courageously standing onstage &#8212; and what am I doing? </p>
<p>Drinking a coffee, hiding in the shadows.</p>
<p>Who am I to judge? </p>
<p>Who am I to say that her voice is &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;bad&#8221; or that her art is &#8220;worthy&#8221; or &#8220;not worthy&#8221;?</p>
<p>I felt a voice enter into my mind &#8212; my intuition, or maybe God, or maybe a sudden remembrance of something that someone said to me long ago &#8212; and I specifically heard the following phrase:</p>
<p><strong>Show some respect for the brave.<br />
</strong><br />
Good advice.</p>
<p>Humbling advice.</p>
<p>I hope, going forward, that I will remember this woman, that night, and those words. </p>
<p>I hope I don&#8217;t get pulled back into the undertow of bad habits, snarky-ness, meanness, or bullying of any kind. </p>
<p>I hope I remember that anyone who is brave enough to stand in front of the world &#8212; to read a poem, to share a story, to sing a song, or to (gasp!) give something a try even if they&#8217;re not &#8220;perfect&#8221; yet &#8212; deserves my respect. </p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if I think it&#8217;s &#8220;good&#8221; or not. That&#8217;s not the point. </p>
<p>Courage, in any form &#8212; on key or out of tune, shaky or impeccable &#8212; is an extraordinary thing to behold and if you&#8217;re fortunate enough to bear witness to such a moment, put down your phone, set down your drink, shut up and listen. </p>
<p>One day, when you are attempting something big, challenging, awkward, or just unsteady and new, you might be grateful that people offer that same respect to you. </p>
<p>I hope I remember that, too.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2015/09/29/cat/"><![CDATA[<p>Why do you write? Why do you make things? Why create stuff?</p>
<p>To win fame? To impress people? To earn a living? Just because it&#8217;s fun? All of the above?</p>
<p>Most of the time &#8212; for ego-based reasons or financial reasons or both &#8212; we don&#8217;t write JUST because it&#8217;s fun. No. Nuh uh. That&#8217;s not enough. We want (no, NEED) our projects to be a serious financial, social, personal and professional &#8220;success.&#8221;</p>
<p>We place so much &#8220;pressure&#8221; on our writing to &#8220;perform&#8221; in a specific way. </p>
<p>&#8220;This piece of writing MUST translate into money, attention, fan mail, appreciation, fame, opportunities, etc.&#8221; we think, secretly and privately, in dark, frightened moments. &#8220;Or else, all of this work is just a waste of my time.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an awful lot of pressure to place on a poor little piece of writing that just wants to be born and find its way in the world. An awful lot of pressure to place on yourself, too. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/" target="_blank">Elizabeth Gilbert</a> talks about this painful situation in her latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Magic-Creative-Living-Beyond-ebook/dp/B00S52M350" target="_blank">Big Magic</a>. </p>
<p>Gilbert says (I&#8217;m paraphrasing) that when you place tons of pressure on a piece of writing and you NEED it to perform in a specific way OR ELSE, it is kind of like screaming various demands at a cat. The cat doesn&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re talking about. The cat doesn&#8217;t know how to give you what you want. The cat just thinks you look mean and crazy and wants to hide under a sofa.</p>
<p>Like most people, I swing between various emotional states. </p>
<p>Some days I pet the cat. </p>
<p>Some days I yell at the cat.</p>
<p>Some days I&#8217;m in love with writing for the sheer joy of writing, feeling very Buddha-like and unattached as words pour through my fingertips. </p>
<p>Other days I wait anxiously to find out if something I&#8217;ve written has helped a <a href="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/ghostwriting-special-projects/" target="_blank">client</a> to have a six figure product launch or secure a book deal or a screenwriting deal because if not, obviously I have failed as a human being. </p>
<p>Other days I frump around because nobody seemed to enjoy my latest blog post as much as I thought they would. </p>
<p>Other days I close my keyboard and consider becoming a hairstylist. </p>
<p>After reading Gilbert&#8217;s book, though, I&#8217;ve become delighted by the &#8220;cat metaphor.&#8221; </p>
<p>Now, on tough days when I am being so hard on myself, so hard on my writing, so relentlessly demanding and rigidly fixated on specific outcomes that I want and maybe can&#8217;t have &#8212; on tough days when my ego feels like a bottomless pit that will never be satisfied &#8212; I can laugh at myself a bit more. I can say to myself, &#8220;Dude. Stop yelling at the cat.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Except I&#8217;m allergic to cats, so in my mind, I imagine an <a href="https://youtu.be/jkdRoNP4bQQ" target="_blank">adorable Shih Tzu puppy</a>. And then I immediately want to stop yelling at that poor puppy! She just wants to love me and play with me! I couldn&#8217;t possibly keep screaming at that little sweetheart. That would be so cruel and unreasonable.)</p>
<p>Are you having a rough day where you feel invisible, untalented, and annoyed because the world isn&#8217;t rejoicing and throwing parades in your honor every time you publish a new blog post or release a newsletter or book? </p>
<p>Are you placing heavy, strict, unreasonable demands on your writing, insisting that it &#8220;perform&#8221; for you or else?</p>
<p>Are you yelling at yourself, yelling at your creative spirit, and yelling at your work like a mean, abusive boss who is never satisfied and never will be?</p>
<p>I have one piece of advice for you (courtesy of Liz G):</p>
<p><strong>Dude. Stop yelling at the cat.</strong></p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2015/09/25/finish-it/"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I sent out an email to everyone who purchased my online writing course, <a href="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/unstoppable/" target="_blank">Unstoppable</a>, this year.</p>
<p>I asked five questions. My intention was to collect feedback, see how people were doing, and hopefully provide a little encouragement to keep going.</p>
<p>One question I asked was:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Have you gotten around to using the course yet? If not, why not?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I got many diverse responses, as you might imagine, but one woman&#8217;s answer struck me as exceptionally honest &#8212; and a little heartbreaking. </p>
<p>She explained that she felt frustrated because when it comes to writing, but also other areas of her life, she feels like she never &#8220;finishes&#8221; anything. </p>
<p><em>&#8220;I try to do too many things and don&#8217;t really finish anything [&#8230;] I&#8217;ve done a few writing classes, worked with coaches, but haven&#8217;t completed anything.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Now, I do finish a lot of things. Some would consider me to be fairly prolific. I&#8217;ve had a couple of <a href="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/shop/" target="_blank">books</a> published and sold in bookstores. I&#8217;ve also self-published numerous other books and hundreds of <a href="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/all/" target="_blank">articles</a> for this site and others. I&#8217;ve also written and edited thousands of pages of content for my <a href="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/ghostwriting-special-projects/" target="_blank">clients</a> over the years. </p>
<p>On the surface, I&#8217;m aware that I appear very &#8220;put together&#8221; and &#8220;efficient,&#8221; and a good deal of the time, that&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Postcards I (still) need to finish. Emails I (still) need to send. Ideas for programs and courses and art projects that I&#8217;ve sorta half-birthed but not quite. </p>
<p>I wrote an entire novel this year &#8212; brand new, possibly my best fiction writing ever &#8212; and then I stopped just before the last chapter. Why? Dunno. I taught a few workshops. Took on a few extra ghostwriting projects. Went on a trip. You know. Stuff. Things. &#8220;Life.&#8221; Basically, I just got distracted and I lost my momentum. The book remains unfinished and it haunts me. Every time I see the manuscript on my desktop, I cringe. When will I finish the damn thing?!! I honestly don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>All of this may sound dramatic, but if you&#8217;re an &#8220;artist&#8221; (and I believe everyone is) then you understand this particular flavor of pain. </p>
<p>When you long to create something &#8212; but you can&#8217;t seem to finish what you&#8217;ve started &#8212; it is like a little ghost haunting you, whining, crying, &#8220;Why why why? What about me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Conversely, when you yearn to bring something into the world and then you actually follow through and finish it? Whoa. Fireworks explosion of goodness. It&#8217;s like adding a one thousand dollar bill to your confidence and self-esteem bank. Nothing feels better than saying, &#8220;I did it. I finished it. It&#8217;s done.&#8221; </p>
<p>This goes for writing, all kinds of creative pursuits, fitness, you name it. </p>
<p>I think we can all agree: </p>
<p><strong>Finishing is sexy.</strong></p>
<p>Which brings me, at last, to the inspirational list that I wanted to share today:</p>
<p><strong>7 beautiful, meaningful writing projects that you can finish in a single day. </strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, when you are stuck in a cycle of non-finishing, the best thing to do is to radically change your goals. </p>
<p>Instead of trying to tackle a gigantic, <em>War &#038; Peace</em>-sized writing project, shrink things down so that you can actually finish something (anything!) and feel good about it.</p>
<p>I call this &#8220;setting sane, humane writing goals.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Sane, humane&#8221; writing projects &#8212; simple mini projects that don&#8217;t take very long to complete &#8212; can still make a real impact in someone else&#8217;s life, despite their &#8220;tiny-ness.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>1. THE &#8220;SIX MINUTE FAN LETTER.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>Set a timer for six minutes. Write a fan letter (or fan email) to someone you admire. </p>
<p>Say something like:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I love your work because ______. My favorite thing you&#8217;ve ever created is ______. You inspire me to ______ and I wanted to thank you for ______. This is purely a fan letter. No response required.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Finish it. Send it. Know that you&#8217;ve just created a positive ripple in someone else&#8217;s day. </p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p><strong>2. THE &#8220;LOCAL HERO&#8221; LOVE NOTE.<br />
</strong><br />
Set a timer for ten minutes. Write a gratitude letter to someone in your local community who is just flat out awesome. A bartender. A grocery bagger. Your yoga teacher. </p>
<p>Say something like:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re my neighbor because ______. I can always count on you to ______. I always notice when you ______ and I appreciate it so much. You make my day better every time you ______. Thank you for being ______.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>(Or use a template from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/50-Ways-Say-Youre-Awesome/dp/1402285663/" target="_blank">my book</a>.)</p>
<p>Finish it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nnV262Egucw" target="_blank">Fold it into an origami heart</a> or if that&#8217;s too complex, just tuck it into an envelope. Deliver it. They will never forget it.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p><strong>3. THE &#8220;GRACIOUS HOST&#8221; WELCOME NOTE.</strong></p>
<p>Set a timer for twenty minutes. Pretend that a guest is coming to stay in your home tonight. They&#8217;ll be staying for a few days. Write a list of instructions for the house, things to know, important phone numbers, and neat local attractions that they ought to check out. </p>
<p>Now, the next time you have a guest, tenant, or AirBnB boarder, you&#8217;ll have a delightful print-out to give them.</p>
<p><strong>4. THE &#8220;FUTURE ME&#8221; LIST.</strong></p>
<p>Set a timer for six minutes. Write a list of six things that you want to do, try, or experience in the upcoming year. </p>
<p>Load the text into <a href="https://www.futureme.org/" target="_blank">FutureMe.org</a> and set it up so that your list will swing back into your inbox on January 1st, 2016. Now you&#8217;ll get a reminder from your past self&#8230; in the future. </p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p><strong>5. THE &#8220;DINNER PARTY&#8221; SURPRISE.</strong></p>
<p>Set a timer for twenty minutes. Jot down the names of a few people that you would love to invite to dinner (real people or, if you want to make this a fiction-writing exercise, imaginary people). Write a dinner party invitation. </p>
<p>Say something like: </p>
<p><em>&#8220;I miss all of you. I want to catch up, face to face, without our cellphones, just sharing an evening together. So I&#8217;m throwing a dinner party! I will make ______. You can bring ______. We&#8217;ll talk about ______ and sip ______ and it will be ______. It&#8217;s happening on ______ at ______pm at ______. I can&#8217;t wait. I hope you will come.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Send out your invite &#8212; you can email it or get it printed and snail-mail it if you want to be exceptionally fancy &#8212; and then enjoy your beautiful night. </p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p><strong>6. THE &#8220;NO EXPECTATIONS&#8221; MEDIA PITCH.</strong></p>
<p>Set a timer for ten minutes. Jot down the name of a blogger, journalist, essayist, writer, producer, radio host, or podcaster that you genuinely love and whose work you follow closely. Write an email to them. </p>
<p>In your email, mention an idea for something you&#8217;d like to see them discuss, write about, or create in the future. </p>
<p>Say something like: </p>
<p><em>&#8220;I love your work and I especially enjoyed your recent ______ which inspired me to ______. I&#8217;ve got an idea for you: have you ever considered doing a [piece / episode / talk / program / article] on [topic]? I bet your fans would love that. (I know I would!). Just wanted to toss that idea your way. Thank you for being you&#8230; and I look forward to your next ______!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Send off your email. Release all expectations of getting a response. Just send it. </p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;ll hear back. Maybe you won&#8217;t. Maybe this will be the beginning of a wonderful friendship or professional relationship. Maybe not. Maybe you&#8217;ll exchange several enthusiastic emails back and forth and it will all culminate with you getting invited to come onto the show. Or not. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry about the end-game. Just send it. Feed someone an idea and leave it at that.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p><strong>7. THE &#8220;FAMILY RECIPE&#8221; BOOK.</strong></p>
<p>Set a timer for fifteen minutes. Write down the recipe for your favorite &#8220;family meal&#8221; or &#8220;childhood snack,&#8221; no matter how silly or simple it is. </p>
<p>Add a little &#8220;intro story&#8221; about why you love it so much, who made this recipe first, or the memories it brings up for you. </p>
<p>Paste your recipe and story into an email. Send it to your family &#8212; or people who feel like &#8220;family&#8221; to you. They&#8217;ll love it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re done! If you want to take this project further, you could&#8230;</p>
<p>Invite everyone in your family to contribute a beloved recipe of their own. Say, <em>&#8220;Email your recipe and story to me.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Collect recipes from everyone. Then get the collection printed through <a href="http://Blurb.com" target="_blank">Blurb</a> or <a href="http://Lulu.com" target="_blank">Lulu</a>. Too complicated? Just print it out using a regular printer and staple it together. DONE. Now you have a cookbook of family stories, memories, and meals to recreate and remember forever.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Try one of these mini projects. Or try all of them. Or choose one and do it once a day for seven days. Or do them all in one day. Do whatever feels good. </p>
<p>The beauty is that none of these projects require &#8220;masterful perfection&#8221; in order to really make a difference in someone else&#8217;s life &#8212; or your own. </p>
<p>A love letter with a typo is still a love letter. A recipe with a stain on it or the &#8220;wrong&#8221; font formatting will still delight your grandkids in forty years. Love is love is love. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry about being &#8220;perfect.&#8221; Just get to the finish line.</p>
<p><strong>Every single time you finish something, no matter how small, your focus and confidence will grow.</strong></p>
<p>Finishing is seriously the best. You know how good it feels.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re just six, ten or maybe twenty minutes away from that feeling. Go get it.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2015/09/22/do-your-own-thing/"><![CDATA[<p>I was in my early twenties, working at a large, impressive company with hundreds of employees. </p>
<p>I certainly didn&#8217;t have my &#8220;dream job&#8221; but I had a perfectly decent job with health care benefits, which was more than most of my friends could say. I felt lucky to be employed. That was enough.</p>
<p>One week, I got invited to attend a special lunch meeting and quickly tapped &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How fun!&#8221; I thought to myself, envisioning a lively discussion and (hopefully) a free sandwich or salad.</p>
<p>I arrived at the meeting and my enthusiasm quickly cooled into dread.</p>
<p>I noticed that every single person in the room was an &#8220;assistant&#8221; of some kind. (My job title included the word &#8220;assistant,&#8221; too, so I was definitely part of the crew.) Everyone looked tired. Nobody looked happy. Fluorescent lights sizzled above. One thing was clear: there would be no free sandwich.</p>
<p>The meeting began and &#8212; I kid you not &#8212; the people inside the room devoted twenty minutes to discussing the plight of never having enough staples and paper clips. Were people stealing them? What could be done about this? Who was to blame?</p>
<p>I shriveled into my seat, feeling like I was part of some horrific office-culture mock-umentary film or reality show, unwilling to participate, sad that I was missing out on my only real &#8220;break&#8221; in the day.</p>
<p>In that moment, I realized&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Yeah. I think I&#8217;m ready to stop being an &#8220;assistant.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Because&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Oh God, no&#8230; if I remain in this kind of position, THIS could be my future. </em></p>
<p>That was the moment where I decided that I needed to take action, right away, to redirect the course of my career. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an assistant, and you&#8217;re over it, and you want to step into something new &#8212; a new career, a new professional identity, or even reinventing yourself as a freelancer, full time artist, or entrepreneur &#8212; this is my advice for you:</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Fiercely carve out time for your own projects, even if you have a full time job. </strong></p>
<p>If you want to be a professional writer one day, you must carve out time to write, hone your skills, and build up a body of work. Ditto if you want to be an artist. Ditto if you want to teach martial arts. Ditto for everything. Whatever you long to do for your &#8220;real&#8221; career, one day, start doing it now. Even if you&#8217;re very busy and have very little time. Find a way.</p>
<p>(Everyone: read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Die-Empty-Unleash-Your-Every/dp/1591845890" target="_blank">Die Empty</a> by <a href="http://www.toddhenry.com/" target="_blank">Todd Henry</a> if you&#8217;re really struggling with this. It&#8217;s the best book I&#8217;ve ever read on the topic of &#8220;finding time to do work that matters.&#8221; Writers and aspiring writers: <a href="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/unstoppable/" target="_blank">I made this for you</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Don&#8217;t hide in the closet. Let people know what you&#8217;re up to. </strong></p>
<p>I remember a guy from IT who sent an email around saying, &#8220;Hey everyone! My band has a gig tonight. Come by!&#8221; </p>
<p>Nothing about this guy screamed &#8220;musician&#8221; to me and I was totally surprised by this invitation. I went to the gig. HE WAS INCREDIBLE. Truly, a prodigious talent. I thought about him differently from that moment onward. Everyone did. With one email and one performance, he re-branded himself within the company.</p>
<p>Nobody can help you, support you, promote you, or help open doors for you if they have no clue what you&#8217;re up to.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Stop referring to yourself as an &#8220;assistant&#8221; (even if that&#8217;s your current gig).</strong></p>
<p>Words are like magnets. Whatever you call yourself, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll magnetize back into your life. What you say is what you get. </p>
<p>If you refer to yourself as an &#8220;assistant,&#8221; then that is the &#8220;box&#8221; that people will put you in, even if you have plenty of other remarkable abilities. </p>
<p>So if people ask about your current job, don&#8217;t say, &#8220;I&#8217;m an administrative assistant at a media company.&#8221; Just say, &#8220;I work at a media company. But I&#8217;m resigning on [date] to pursue my passion which is ______.&#8221; </p>
<p>Or if you recently quit your job, say, &#8220;I worked for a big tech company. I stepped down from my position last year to launch my own business which is ______.&#8221; and leave your previous job title out of it, unless they press you for more details. </p>
<p>Obviously, don&#8217;t lie about your background, credentials or previous work experience. But whenever possible, shine the spotlight on where you&#8217;re going, not where you&#8217;ve been.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211; Set an end date. Leave.</strong></p>
<p>I remember how exhilarating it felt to circle a date on the calendar and then declare to myself &#8212; and later, my boss &#8212; <em>That&#8217;s my last day. Thanks for the opportunities. I&#8217;m leaving.<br />
</em><br />
Setting a firm date for your departure can be equal parts thrilling and terrifying, but one thing is for sure: it will light a fire under your ass. </p>
<p>With a firm date on the calendar, you&#8217;ll discover inner reserves of creativity, resourcefulness, hustle and grit you never knew you had. </p>
<p>You will be compelled to take action to set up the next chapter of your career. You won&#8217;t procrastinate any longer. You will make things happen. </p>
<p><strong>&#8211; &#8220;Helping&#8221; is great. &#8220;Helping&#8221; (while ignoring your true calling) is not.</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing &#8220;wrong&#8221; with being someone&#8217;s assistant. In some ways, every single career in the world requires you to &#8220;assist&#8221; others in some capacity &#8212; so we&#8217;re all &#8220;assistants&#8221; in our own way. We&#8217;re all &#8220;helpers.&#8221; </p>
<p>The issue is when &#8220;assisting others&#8221; means that you are perpetually avoiding the creative projects or pursuits that you really long to do. Or when &#8220;assisting others&#8221; means you are investing all of your time and energy helping other people to build their empires and share their stories, while ignoring your own. Or  when &#8220;assisting others&#8221; means you are keeping your heart tight and your life small. That&#8217;s not good. </p>
<p>Avoid a future riddled with resentment by laying the groundwork for the next chapter of your life and career, now. </p>
<p>Even if you need to hang onto your assistant gig awhile longer, just to pay the bills, that&#8217;s fine. You can still find small ways to move forward and roll into what&#8217;s next. </p>
<p>One, two or five years from now, when nobody is asking you &#8220;Who moved my paperclips?!&#8221; or &#8220;Could you sort these sugar packets and separate white from brown?&#8221; you will be really glad that you re-directed your career, starting today.</p>

If you&#8217;re ready for a career change and feel like you need help to make it happen, I recommend acquainting yourself with <a href="http://www.whenigrowupcoach.com/" target="_blank">Michelle</a>, <a href="http://ellenfondiler.com/" target="_blank">Ellen</a>, <a href="http://shyatt.com" target="_blank">Susan</a>, and <a href="http://drsuzannegelb.com/" target="_blank">Suzanne</a>. All of these women have tons of career-change expertise. I know them personally and admire their work. Read their blogs. Consider hiring one of them to coach you, if it suits you. Or find at least one friend or family member who can help you. Change is never &#8220;easy&#8221; but it&#8217;s a hell of a lot easier with at least one cheerleader on your team. You got this!</p></blockquote>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2015/09/16/how-to-love-your-work-even-when-you-dont-love-your-work/"><![CDATA[<p>Maybe you&#8217;re doing data-entry just to bide the time while you search for a full time job at a company you admire. Maybe you&#8217;re running a business that you (mostly, totally) love except for those moments when you don&#8217;t. Maybe you&#8217;re just experiencing a creative dry spell. Nothing feels exciting. But things still need to get done.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of job, gig or career you&#8217;ve got going on, there are bound to be times when you are just not &#8220;loving it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Should you quit? Switch to a totally different career and start over? Self-medicate with pot brownies because, hey, it&#8217;s legal in some states and YOLO!</p>
<p>These are a few of your options, certainly. But maybe not the best ones.</p>
<p>Before you crumple into a pile of sadness, try some of these strategies:</p>
<p><strong>&#8212; Make adjustments.</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, I was feeling burnt out so I had a chat with my clients. </p>
<p>I explained that I could no longer clip along at the same super-speedy pace they&#8217;d been accustomed to. I told them that from now on, I would still deliver the same amount of work (aka: completed writing projects) for the same price, but the pacing would be a little slower. As in, &#8220;You can expect to receive this in a couple of days, but not, like, tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>They said: &#8220;Makes sense. No problem!&#8221; (Because they are awesome like that.) </p>
<p>I breathed a sigh of relief. This one adjustment changed the entire quality of my life. </p>
<p>Is there one glaring issue with your job or career? One &#8220;energy leak&#8221; that keeps coming up, sucking light out of your week? One adjustment that might change your whole day? </p>
<p>Before you decide to quit, make some  adjustments and see if your attitude about your work starts to change. You might not actually &#8220;hate&#8221; your work. You might just be tired! Change things up and then review. One change might be all you need to do.</p>
<p><strong>&#8212; Change your environment.</strong></p>
<p>Get out of the house, office, or cubicle. Work in a coffee shop, public library, or co-working space. Take your work on the road. I am doing a solo-road-trip later this autumn because I always feel invigorated when I&#8217;m working somewhere &#8220;else.&#8221; <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/for-a-more-creative-brain-travel/388135/" target="_blank">Travel opens your mind.</a></p>
<p><strong>&#8212; Focus on the bright spots.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all bad, right? Maybe you have really wonderful co-workers. Or the kindest, most generous clients. Or free, unlimited coffee in the staff kitchen. Or a really comfy office chair with sweet-ass wheels. Yeah. I said sweet-ass wheels. </p>
<p>Even if it feels silly and childish, try to focus on the bright spots in your day. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ocean-robbins/having-gratitude-_b_1073105.html" target="_blank">Gratitude re-wires your brain.</a> It&#8217;s been proven that the more you reflect on what&#8217;s going &#8220;right&#8221; in your life, the better you feel. </p>
<p><strong>&#8212; Review your Happy File.</strong></p>
<p>I keep a &#8220;Happy File&#8221; in my inbox &#8212; a folder filled with compliments, praise, kind notes from clients and folks who read my blog, plus notes from family and friends. </p>
<p>When I&#8217;m feeling stressed or depressed, I dig into my Happy File and quickly remember, &#8220;Oh yeah! I am pretty awesome. I help people. People like me. I am not alone in this world.&#8221;</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://www.sarahvonbargen.com/" target="_blank">Sarah</a> gave me the Happy File idea. She visits her file whenever she gets a snarky comment on her blog or a rough piece of criticism. It puts her mind right back on track. </p>
<p><strong>&#8212; Rest more. Play more.</strong></p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://melissacassera.com/" target="_blank">Melissa</a> advocates scheduling a &#8220;Pleasure Break&#8221; into your workday &#8212; a 30 minute break to read magazines, watch an uplifting TV show, sip a latte, stretch your legs, and just bring some fresh energy into your day. </p>
<p>My mom often reminds me, &#8220;When you feel like you can&#8217;t possibly afford to stop and take a break, not even for 1 minute, that&#8217;s exactly the moment when you need a break most of all.&#8221; My mom is really smart.</p>
<p><strong>&#8212; Ride it out.</strong></p>
<p>I know professional musicians, Broadway singers, pastry bakers, TV writers, life coaches, physicians, all kinds of people who absolutely love their work &#8212; except for when they don&#8217;t!</p>
<p>Experiencing a &#8220;lull&#8221; where you feel uninspired, stressed, or burnt out does not mean that you are a &#8220;bad&#8221; or &#8220;ungrateful&#8221; person, and it does not necessarily mean that you chose the &#8220;wrong&#8221; career. </p>
<p>What you&#8217;re feeling right now could be temporary. Just ride it out &#8212; at least for a little while. </p>
<p>If things keep dragging on, and nothing seems to be improving your outlook, check in with your doctor to rule out a health condition, chat with a <a href="http://shyatt.com/" target="_blank">life coach</a>, <a href="http://ellenfondiler.com/" target="_blank">career strategist</a>, or <a href="http://drsuzannegelb.com/" target="_blank">psychologist</a>, and / or get a reading from a <a href="http://www.thetarotlady.com/" target="_blank">professional mystic</a> (maybe Saturn is moving forward in your chart and creating a topsy-turvy emotional state where your &#8220;life purpose&#8221; doesn&#8217;t seem to make sense anymore! See what the stars have to say. Couldn&#8217;t hurt!)</p>
<p><strong>&#8212; Hit the finish line &#8212; just because it&#8217;s the right thing to do.</strong></p>
<p>I know that when &#8220;work&#8221; starts to feel like &#8220;drudgery,&#8221; it can be so tempting to quit immediately, walk away, email your clients and say &#8220;I am over it!&#8221;, or start secretly browsing job listings when you&#8217;re supposed to be on the clock. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to explore future opportunities &#8212; go for it, by all means &#8212; but don&#8217;t leave your current colleagues, boss or clients in a rough spot by departing too abruptly.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve made a commitment to stay and work until, say, the end of the year, then do it. Follow through. Hit the finish line. </p>
<p>I know from personal experience that crossing that &#8220;finish line&#8221; will boost your self esteem (&#8220;It was tough, but I am proud of myself. I did the honorable thing.&#8221;) and it&#8217;s the best way to keep your professional relationships intact. </p>
<p>You can build new bridges without burning the ones you&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>And who knows? By sticking to your current course just a little bit longer, you might actually ride through this rough patch and fall more deeply in love with your work than ever before.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the eve of their 29th wedding anniversary, I asked my father, <strong>&#8220;What&#8217;s the secret to long-lasting love?&#8221;</strong> </p>
<p>He told me, &#8220;I have fallen in love with your mother many times. I fall in love with your mother in new ways through the years.&#8221; </p>
<p>I know that &#8220;falling in love&#8221; and then &#8220;falling in love again&#8221; is possible because it&#8217;s happened to me many times with people, with writing, with work, with all kinds of things.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re not loving your work right now, be patient. Make adjustments if necessary. Explore new options but don&#8217;t jump ship too quickly. Hang in there and hold out for love&#8230; again.</p>
<p>All is not lost. It never is.</p>
<p>Love has a way of coming back around again.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2015/09/11/are-you-pretending-to-be-miserable/"><![CDATA[<p>It all started back in high school. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always had a semi-photographic memory and I can retain big sections of text in my mind and repeat them back verbatim. My classmates would tease me about this and call me a &#8220;teacher&#8217;s pet&#8221; or a &#8220;know it all.&#8221; </p>
<p>Over time, I got tired of &#8220;standing out.&#8221; So I started pretending that I &#8220;couldn&#8217;t remember.&#8221; </p>
<p>I played dumb.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say to a classmate, &#8220;What was the point of Chapter 11?&#8221; or &#8220;What does that word mean?&#8221; or &#8220;What&#8217;s our homework assignment again?&#8221; even though I already knew the answer. </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t think about it like this at the time, but looking back I can see that I was downplaying my abilities &#8212; &#8220;toning it down&#8221; &#8212; in order to feel accepted by my peers. </p>
<p>This is a really dangerous habit. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s very common &#8212; especially among women and girls.</p>
<p>A recent university <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/08/140805090947.htm">study</a> shows that &#8220;girls feel the need to play down their intelligence to not intimidate boys.&#8221; </p>
<p>Another <a href="http://techland.time.com/2010/11/22/study-teen-girls-act-mean-play-dumb-online/" target="_blank">study</a> suggests that girls downplay their intelligence online because being &#8220;smart&#8221; doesn&#8217;t translate into &#8220;online currency&#8221; (aka: attention and acceptance) as much as being &#8220;fun&#8221; does. </p>
<p>Can we all just&#8230; stop this?</p>
<p>This is a message to everyone (and mostly to myself):</p>
<p>Pretending to be less happy, less smart, or less ambitious than you really are does NOT help you, your community or the planet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your playing small does not serve the world,&#8221; says Marianne Williamson. Amen to that. </p>
<p>If someone is jealous because of something you can do, that&#8217;s their issue, not yours. The reverse is true as well. If someone&#8217;s magnificence makes you feel small and unimportant by comparison, that&#8217;s your issue, not theirs.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t <a href="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2014/04/17/let-us-be-happy-for-you/" target="_blank">downplay</a> your  wonderfulness. It&#8217;s not helpful. It&#8217;s not accurate. It&#8217;s not right.</p>
<p><strong>Crank up the light.</strong></p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2015/09/09/no-regrets/"><![CDATA[<p>A woman named <a href="http://www.connieville.com" target="_blank">Connie</a> wrote to me recently. </p>
<p>She receives my <a href="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/newsletter/" target="_blank">newsletter</a> and something I wrote &#8212; about spending less time online &#8212; resonated with her and she wanted to say &#8220;thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her email, Connie told me about some recent choices that she has made. </p>
<p>Choices like spending less time tethered to a digital screen and spending more time savoring everyday life with her daughter. </p>
<p>She described how she &#038; her daughter have been spending the summertime.</p>
<p>She wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of being on the computer, we browsed books at the library.<br />
Instead of sticking to a blogging schedule, we chased fireflies.<br />
Instead of marketing, we made s&#8217;mores.<br />
Instead of spending my evening taking phone calls, we took twice as long to cook a meal so she could help me make it. </p>
<p>I regret nothing. </p></blockquote>
<p>Those final three words &#8212; &#8220;I regret nothing&#8221; &#8212; gripped me by the heart. </p>
<p>I asked Connie if I could share a snippet of her email and she graciously said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Connie&#8217;s email reminded me to re-evaluate how I spend my time each day and ask myself, &#8220;Am I setting myself up for satisfaction or regret?&#8221; </p>
<p>Work is wonderful. Making money is important. The Internet is amazing. Yes, yes and yes. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s important to question how much time we pour into work things / money things / Internet-ish things and really ask, &#8220;Do I need to be spending THAT much time doing that? Every day? Really? How come? Who says?&#8221; and &#8220;What if I spent some of my life minutes doing something else instead?&#8221;</p>
<p>Like Connie, I want to be able to confidently say &#8220;I regret nothing&#8221; at the end of each day &#8212; and certainly at the end of my life.</p>
<p>(Or at least, &#8220;I regret almost nothing &#8212; except for that phase in my late teens when I thought wearing over-sized jeans that sank below my butt was really hip and cool. That part, maybe, I could have re-considered.&#8221;)</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What can I choose &#8212; [today / this season / this year] &#8212; that will carry me towards maximum satisfaction and minimal regret?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That is a beautiful question.</p>
<p>Connie knows her answer.</p>
<p>What is yours?</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2015/09/09/how-to-be-more-interesting-than-a-phone/"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been to a party where everyone in the room is staring down at their phones instead of talking to one another?</p>
<p>Or a concert where everyone is recording the musical performance on their devices instead of actually experiencing the music?</p>
<p>I realize that I sound like a grumpy tech-phobic curmudgeon (I&#8217;m not, really).</p>
<p>But these kinds of scenes are distressingly common.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the problem: </p>
<p>Phones are really interesting. More than just interesting &#8212; they are infinitely mesmerizing and entertaining!</p>
<p>Smartphones are like a 24/7 candy store for the senses &#8212; endless information at your fingertips, content to consume in never-ending spirals, voyeuristic peeks into other people&#8217;s lives, opportunities to receive the delicious dopamine pellet validation-spike of a &#8220;like&#8221; or &#8220;re-tweet&#8221; at any moment you wish. </p>
<p>To hold people&#8217;s attention in this day and age, you&#8217;ve got some pretty stiff competition.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got to be&#8230; more interesting than a phone. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s no easy feat. But with a little flair and effort, it can be done!</p>
<p>Here are my personal recommendations on how to be more interesting than a phone:</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Wear an amazing hat. </em></p>
<p>This is not a joke. My mom now wears a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fascinator&#038;tbm=isch&#038;tbo=u&#038;source=univ&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=0CEkQsARqFQoTCILBmaWp5ccCFVOdiAodQqEI0g&#038;biw=1310&#038;bih=707" target="_blank">fascinator</a> &#8212; a tiny decorative hat with feathers, lace, and beads &#8212; pretty much every time she leaves the house, be it to the grocery store or a black tie event. It&#8217;s a show stopper. People rush towards her in amazement, crying out, &#8220;What is that on your head? Who are you? I must know you!!&#8221; Elderly patrons of the arts throw themselves at her. Gay men question their orientations. People lose their shit over these fascinators. I am telling you: get an amazing hat because it might change your life and the world.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Invite people to talk about themselves.</em></p>
<p>There is a reason why social media has become wildly popular &#8212; it&#8217;s a forum for billions of people to talk about themselves without interruption!</p>
<p>Most people thoroughly enjoy talking about themselves &#8212; especially if you ask a <a href="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2014/11/26/100-questions-to-spark-conversation-connection-at-the-thanksgiving-table/" target="_blank">fun, exciting question</a> like &#8220;What are you obsessed with these days?&#8221; or &#8220;What&#8217;s the last TV show or book that totally pulled you in?&#8221; or &#8220;Do you believe in ghosts?&#8221;</p>
<p>Invite people to tell you a story about themselves, listen intently, and they will adore you.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Make people feel sexy.</em></p>
<p>When was the last time that someone flirted unabashedly with you? Or made you feel exceptionally desirable? Or gave you a bold compliment? I bet you can remember that moment vividly. It is forever etched into your mind.</p>
<p>Offer droplets of appreciation like, &#8220;You look especially handsome right now.&#8221; &#8220;You are a goddess.&#8221; &#8220;Look at those gams! Lock up your daughters!&#8221; &#8220;Beyoncé called: she wants her bootie back!&#8221; &#8220;Your smile lights up the whole room!&#8221; &#8220;Your eyes look like liquid chocolate!&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to feel sexy and you can provide that feeling. You don&#8217;t have to be lewd or lascivious. Just lock eye contact and say something appreciative. </p>
<p>Can&#8217;t think of anything to say? Listen intently without saying anything. The simple experience of &#8220;being heard&#8221; also makes people feel very sexy.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Bust out a Tarot deck (or another prop of your choosing).</em></p>
<p>I often bring <a href="http://www.gaiantarot.com/" target="_blank">my favorite Tarot deck</a> to parties. I am not a professional reader, but I&#8217;ll ask, &#8220;Does anybody want a reading?&#8221; and pretty much everyone says &#8220;YES!!&#8221; </p>
<p>Soon, the entire room is gathered around and before long, everyone is discussing everyone else&#8217;s readings, emotions are spilled, truths are revealed, plans are made, more wine is poured, and the tedious, phone-focused gathering has been transformed into an unforgettable night!</p>
<p>Maybe Tarot isn&#8217;t your thing. But perhaps you can do astrology&#8230; or magic tricks&#8230; or read palms&#8230; or style hair (I did this at another party, and it was equally awesome)&#8230; or paint tiny hearts on people&#8217;s nails&#8230; or teach people how to flip an omelette using only one hand and no spatula. Choose a prop or talent and invite people to play with you.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Suggest a simple group activity that everyone can do.</em></p>
<p>I once threw a dinner party and told my friends, &#8220;It&#8217;s National Letter Writing Week so how about we all write letters after dinner?&#8221; And we did. And it was wonderful. And nobody was on their phone.</p>
<p><em>&#8212; Be loud or be quiet. Just be you.</em></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t necessarily have to be &#8220;loud&#8221; or &#8220;flashy&#8221; to grip people&#8217;s attention or strike up a conversation.</p>
<p>I am actually a very quiet, introverted person and I rarely enjoy loud chatter or big, boisterous events. </p>
<p>But even if you are soft-spoken with a quiet, peaceful disposition, you can find a way to draw people&#8217;s attention away from their phones and back into the present moment.</p>
<p>Often, all it takes is <a href="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2014/11/26/100-questions-to-spark-conversation-connection-at-the-thanksgiving-table/" target="_blank">one great conversation-sparking question</a>.</p>
<p>If all else fails, I repeat: </p>
<p><em>Wear an amazing hat. </em></p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2015/09/02/good-question-how-can-i-stay-creative/"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Hi Alex,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Do you have any advice on how to stay creative and energized when your work requires you to sit in front of a computer all day? This is something that I have been struggling with. Any techniques you can share?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Cheers,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&#8211;Itai</p></blockquote>
<p>Dear Itai,</p>
<p>This is a terrific question &#8212; one that I grapple with myself, as a full-time writer and computer-strapped person &#8212; and I have several techniques I can share. </p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to stay creative and energized when you have to sit and type all day long, my advice is&#8230;</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Don&#8217;t do it. </em></p>
<p>Just don&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t sit and type all day long. This is terrible for your mind, body and spirit. </p>
<p>Physicians now say that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-active-times/sitting-is-the-new-smokin_b_5890006.html" target="_blank">&#8220;sitting is the new smoking.&#8221;</a> Sitting too much raises your likelihood of developing virtually every disease under the sun, from depression to hypertension to indigestion. It&#8217;s not good.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Cry, mourn, and accept that you may need to overhaul your life in a significant way.</em></p>
<p>Oops! You chose a career that requires you to sit and stare into a screen for <a href="https://www.distractify.com/astounding-facts-about-how-we-actually-spend-our-time-1197818577.html" target="_blank">70% of your waking life</a>. You&#8217;re doomed! Well, not really. You&#8217;re still in charge of your life. </p>
<p>You can change your career (a lot or a little). You can change your daily routine. You can switch to a <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-standing-desk/" target="_blank">standing desk</a>. You can say &#8220;Fuck everything!&#8221; and join a Bollywood dance troupe or become a forest ranger. You can say to yourself, &#8220;You know what? I&#8217;m not OK with being tethered to a computer all day long. I am going to work half-time and make half as much money and be twice as happy. That&#8217;s my new plan.&#8221; It&#8217;s all up to you.</p>
<p>No matter how &#8220;trapped&#8221; you think you are, you are always in charge of your life.</p>
<p>Realizing all of this might stir up a lot of emotions which is why&#8230; it&#8217;s OK to cry.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Write standing up.</em></p>
<p>I like to write standing up beside my kitchen table. Sometimes I flop onto my stomach on my bed. Other people like standing desks or even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TrekDesk-Treadmill-Desks-TD-01-Desk/dp/B002IYRBI0" target="_blank">treadmill desks</a>. Experiment with different options. I repeat: just don&#8217;t sit all day.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Schedule workouts, walks and playtime.</em></p>
<p>Your body was made to move. If you do not move, you will feel uncreative and sad. Even just a little bit of activity &#8212; like a brisk walk five times a week &#8212; can help tremendously. <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Exercise-and-Depression-report-excerpt.htm" target="_blank">SCIENCE</a>.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Have sex with yourself or someone else.</em></p>
<p>You will have a flood of <a href="https://www.bodylogicmd.com/hormone-articles/the-science-of-sex" target="_blank">delightful neurotransmitters</a>. You will feel relaxed. All of your problems will seem smaller. You might even feel inspired to write dopey, smitten love poetry. All great things!</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Look at interesting things and talk to interesting people.</em></p>
<p>I get my best ideas when I am milling about, wandering into random shops, staring at people, or having conversations with friends or strangers. Get out of the house. </p>
<p><em>&#8211; Read books.</em></p>
<p>Remember books? Read them. Read whatever interests you. Read things outside of your &#8220;industry&#8221; to get inspiration from new and diverse sources. </p>
<p><em>&#8211; Watch TV. (But not too much.)</em></p>
<p>I love TV and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s &#8220;bad.&#8221; I love shows with fascinating characters and gripping surprises and excellent writing. A little bit of TV energizes me. Too much makes me sleepy. I like to use TV as a &#8220;brain treat&#8221; to reward myself for finishing a project.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Travel.</em></p>
<p>Your brain <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/for-a-more-creative-brain-travel/388135/" target="_blank">operates differently when you are somewhere &#8220;different,&#8221;</a> which is why many people tend to have big creative epiphanies and bursts of creativity on airplanes, in hotels, at strange bars, in the car, or while traveling to new places. Another great reason to get out of the house!</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Take a shower.</em></p>
<p>When you&#8217;re blissed out in a warm, soapy shower, <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/why-we-have-our-best-ideas-in-the-shower-the-science-of-creativity" target="_blank">your brain produces dopamine</a>, which is a happiness-boosting neurotransmitter that helps you to make creative connections and solve problems in new ways. Also you will smell better.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Cry more.</em></p>
<p>Oh no! You just remembered that despite all of the great sex you just had and that awesome vacation and shower, you still feel shackled to your computer most of the day and it totally sucks. Cry more! You are allowed!</p>
<p>Then channel your grief into a poem, or sign up for an interesting class, or encourage your employer to switch to a <a href="http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/04/4-day-work-week.html" target="_blank">4-day workweek</a>, or watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/JOCtdw9FG-s" target="_blank">tiny hamster eat a tiny burrito</a>. It&#8217;s all going to be OK.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Be grateful.</em></p>
<p>Computers are a miracle. Technology is a miracle. Being able to sit peacefully and wiggle your fingers over a keyboard so that ideas pour out of your brain and turn into sentences on a screen is a miracle.</p>
<p>Yes, technology can be stressful, overwhelming, or tiring at times. But try to avoid complaining because it will only irritate you and others. Instead, try to stay focused on the awesome wonderfulness of everything, as often as you can. Be grateful. </p>
<p>As my friend Susan says, <a href="https://shyatt.com/stay-in-the-miracle/" target="_blank">&#8220;Stay in the miracle.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>I hope that helps, Itai (and others with similar queries).</p>
<p>Now please close your laptop, crumple your tablet, flick off your phone, dismantle your harddrive and go outside for awhile. I promise: you&#8217;ll feel more creative right away and you&#8217;ll have a much lovelier day.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2015/08/25/the-phone-people/"><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Table for two, right this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The host called out my name and guided my boyfriend and I over to a spot on the patio.</p>
<p>It was a glorious, unfairly beautiful summer morning (thanks, global warming!) and we had been waiting an eternity to snag a table at the hottest brunch spot in town. (Portlanders take brunch very seriously. Waiting up to an hour or more is not uncommon.)</p>
<p>We ordered a round of pineapple mimosas, French toast and breakfast corn dogs (whaaat? now!) and sank into our chairs feeling gleeful. What a day!</p>
<p>Then, as we often do, we started scanning the tables around us. </p>
<p>Our favorite restaurant-game is to identify people who appear to be &#8220;on a date&#8221; and then invent stories about them. (&#8220;She&#8217;s a librarian who still believes in true love. He&#8217;s a computer programmer with a heart of gold, yet hiding a dark secret. They&#8217;re going to have their first kiss between the book stacks&#8230; tonight!&#8221;)</p>
<p>But this morning, we struggled to spot lusty couples. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because every single table was full of people&#8230; on their phones.</p>
<p>We did a quick survey and literally every single table had a minimum (minimum!) of two smartphones resting on the surface. Many brunchers held phones in their hands or on their laps. Many were snapping photos of the food. I do believe one person was snapping a photo of someone snapping a photo of their food. Many were texting while peering over the top of their phone to simultaneously chat with their dining companions. Or ignoring their companions completely.</p>
<p>We started to play a new game. </p>
<p>When a new group of diners got seated at their table, we would place our bets. </p>
<p>&#8220;How many seconds before at least 1 person at the table pulls out their phone?&#8221; </p>
<p>I generously wagered, &#8220;40 seconds.&#8221; I was way off. The average was 14 seconds. Whoa.</p>
<p>I started to feel extremely distressed. </p>
<p>&#8220;What is going on here? This is really insane. I am quitting Instagram right away!&#8221; I declared, amidst bites of syrup-soaked toast. (And shortly after that, <a href="https://instagram.com/p/5zygXqHtwr/?taken-by=alx.franzen" target="_blank">I did.</a>)</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about &#8220;The Phone People,&#8221; as we dubbed them &#8212; a play on the 1980s horror film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pod_People" target="_blank">The Pod People</a> &#8212; and even right now, as I look around the coffee shop where I am working, I see them. I see them everywhere. Texting. Tapping. Refreshing. Staring. Glued to their screens. It&#8217;s relentless.</p>
<p>It makes me feel very emotional and I just recently, I have realized why:</p>
<p><strong><em>Because I am a Phone Person, too.</em></strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t play video games on my phone. I <a href="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/2015/08/19/why-i-do-not-use-social-media-anymore/" target="_blank">don&#8217;t use social media</a> anymore. I don&#8217;t snap photos obsessively anymore. </p>
<p>But I do spend 75% of my waking hours attached to some kind of screen, be it a laptop, phone, or reading device. </p>
<p>75% of my LIFE. </p>
<p><a href="http://blog.pgi.com/2013/10/screen-fiends-infographic-reveals-shocking-truths-technology-usage-screen-time/" target="_blank">This is COMMON for Americans</a>. </p>
<p>This is NOT GOOD.</p>
<p>I am starting to formulate my career / business plan for next year &#8212; 2016 &#8212; and several friends and mentors have asked me what kinds of <a href="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/ghostwriting-special-projects/" target="_blank">writing services</a> I plan to offer, if I will teach any workshops, or make any new <a href="http://www.alexandrafranzen.com/unstoppable/" target="_blank">e-courses</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Honestly, at this point? I have no idea. </p>
<p>All I know is that next year, <strong>I do not want to spend more than 4 hours per day in front of a screen.</strong></p>
<p>That is my #1 goal. </p>
<p>I am announcing it here, publicly, to make it feel even more serious and real.</p>
<p>I will hold that goal as my &#8220;bottom line,&#8221; and I will try to design the rest of my life / career accordingly.</p>
<p>Feeling similarly? Some questions to consider:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8211; How many years of your life are you willing to pour into a screen?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8211; How many hours or minutes per day?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8211; What does a &#8220;healthy, sane, reasonable&#8221; relationship with technology look like to you?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8211; How could you get closer to that kind of relationship right now, as well as long term?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8211; What&#8217;s the potential cost if you don&#8217;t?</p></blockquote>
<p>Step #1 is simple: </p>
<p><strong>Put your freaking phone&#8230; down.</strong></p>
